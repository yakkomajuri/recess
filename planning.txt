# What you were doing when you last stopped
- 

# TODO:
- Basic errors to frontend e.g. feed exists
- Allow accessing timeline without logging in, show some explore equivalent without follow buttons
- Feed ownership stuff

# Known performance issues
- One request per feed following

# Important refactors needed
- Sort out user!
- Clean up useState and useEffect
- Standardize and improve pagination
- Error handling
- Feed following buttons (extract?)
- Move to Postgres


# Ideas
- Consolidate Timeline and Explore?
- Play with color palette
- Add analytics
- Utterances-like widget
- Import HN comments
- Suggest feeds to follow if you dont follow any (trending sort of does this?)
