# TODO:
- Feed auto-reloads
- Responsive design
- Feed ownership stuff
- Basic errors to frontend e.g. feed exists

# Known performance issues
- One request per feed following

# Important refactors needed
- Sort out user!
- Clean up useState and useEffect
- Standardize pagination
- Error handling
- Improve pagination
- Feed following buttons (extract?)
- Move to Postgres


# Ideas
- Consolidate Timeline and Explore?
- Allow accessing timeline without logging in, show some explore equivalent without follow buttons
- Play with color palette
- Suggest feeds to follow if you dont follow any
- Add analytics
- Utterances-like widget
- Import HN comments
