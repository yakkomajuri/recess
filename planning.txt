# What you were doing when you last stopped
- 

# TODO:
- Profile
- Feed auto-reloads
- Responsive design
- Feed ownership stuff

# Known performance issues
- Lacking pagination
- One request per feed following

# Important refactors needed
- Feed following buttons (extract?)
- Sort out user!
- Clean up useState and useEffect


# Ideas
- Consolidate Timeline and Explore?
- Allow accessing timeline without logging in, show some explore equivalent without follow buttons
- Play with color palette
- Suggest feeds to follow if you dont follow any
